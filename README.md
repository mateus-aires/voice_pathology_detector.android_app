## About

Voice Pathology Detector is an application developed to help users monitor their vocal health. By utilizing audio signal processing techniques and artificial intelligence, the app records and analyzes sustained vowels ("a", "i", and "u") to identify potential symptoms of vocal diseases.

Please note that Voice Pathology Detector does not replace professional medical evaluation. It is designed to encourage users to seek medical assistance if they have any concerns about their vocal health. The app requires users to be in a quiet environment during the test as it is sensitive to external noises. Additionally, an internet connection is necessary to perform the analysis and provide results.
